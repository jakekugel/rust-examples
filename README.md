# rust-examples
A collection of short educational / recreational programs written in Rust.
I created these while learning Rust programming.

## encode-card-deck

A command-line utility that converts a short text message to or from a list of
52 playing cards.  The order of the cards in the deck is used to encode the
message.

## maze-generator

A command-line utility that generates a PDF file containing a maze.
